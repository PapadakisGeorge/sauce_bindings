There are a number of features we will be looking to add. 
If there is something you'd like to see that isn't on this list, please 
[open a ticket](https://github.com/saucelabs/sauce_bindings/issues/new).

This is the current general plan for going forward:

## 1.2
* Add Accessibility Functionality

## 1.3
* Add Custom Sauce Labs JavaScript command support

## 1.4
* Add Visual Testing Functionality

## 1.5
* Add Emulator/Simulator Functionality

## 1.6
* Add Real Device Functionality

## 2.0
* Remove deprecated features

## Additional Plans
* Methods for Session related information and updates (no need to use a REST Client with our API)
* Methods to work with Extended Debugging Functionality (convert from language data structures instead of requiring JSON)
* Methods for managing assets (screenshots, video, etc)
* Access to improved Failure Analysis
